# Machine-Code-Assembler
Created an assembler that converts LEGv8 into decima. I chose to do this project using Python. The assembler will take a file input containing LEGv8 code and create a file containing the code assembled in decimal – you may choose as a group to leave the opcode as a string, but the remainder of the text file must be in decimal. Refer to the examples on the following pages. You must implement the following: ADD, SUB, AND, ORR, EOR, LSL, LSR, ADDI, SUBI, ANDI, ORRI, EORI, SUBS, SUBIS, LDUR, STUR, CBZ, CBNZ, B, and B.Cond (EQ, NE, GT, GTE, LT, LTE). You do not have to implement anything for functions.In code with loops and branches, labels must be replaced with a numerical value – a positive value for a forward jump and a negative value for a backward jump – which correctly indicates the numbers of instructions you need to move. Hint: use a two-pass assembler – in the first pass convert to decimal and look at the labels counting the number of instruction that you need to jump, in the second pass replace the label with the numerical value – refer to the examples on the following pages.
